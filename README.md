# LaboratoryEscape
The first game/tech demo I created in Unreal Engine 4. 

It is a first-person puzzle game where you can grab certain objects and place them in certain areas to progress through a mysterious laboratory. So far there is only one puzzle, but as I learn how to develop more in UE4, the more this project will grow. 

I learned how to create such a game because of Udemy's Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games. I have been coding in C++ for almost 2 years now, so this course really helped me learn how to use Unreal Engine than it has for C++ (although, it's great for teaching beginners C++ not only just for gaming, but also general standard practices). The assets came from free asset packages within the Unreal Marketplace. 

You will see the names "DungeonEscape" within the repo because initially I had plans of making the environment a dungeon rather than a Laboratory.
